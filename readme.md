# Ditigally Secure Home Security  

This is a project that uses IP cameras, local computing and the encrypted messaging to monitor a location and get notifications with without sending any usable data to outside companies.

Things that you will need:

* Any Reolink camera, as many as you want, but the system will have some delay after 4 cameras
* Raspberry pi 4 (any version) starts at $35
* 8+GB microSD
* Power over Ethernet (PoE) network switch (I used TL-SF1008P which supports 4 cameras) $50
* Networking cables
* A way to mount your cameras (drill, screwdriver, etc)
* A telegram account, or just make a new one
